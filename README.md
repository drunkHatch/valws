Our program runs on lab machine.

Use makefile: 

"make" to run the program valws379 without "-i" option
"make clean" to prepare for next run
"make -i" to run with "-i" option

We did design of the whole program together(linked list, hash table, pipe, gnuplots)

Pair:
  1, treat stream from valgrind
  2, report, deisng, readme, comments

Taijie:
  1, window(main linked list)
  2, logic structure of main() (all if conditions)
  3, generate frequency histogram
  4, functions for adding node and removing node of window

Yuqi:
  1, hash table and structs
  2, functions for adding node and removing node of table
  3, send stream via pipe to gnuplot
